# Homebrew formula for sidestep
# Single channel, kos pattern: updated by CI on every push to main
# (alpha-... versions) and on v* tags (stable versions). The same
# formula tracks the latest published artifact, alpha or stable.
# macOS only (arm64). Linux support is a future option.

    <<~EOS
      sidestep updates on every push to main (alpha versions) until the
      first stable tag is cut.

      Bootstrap a token (recommended — uses macOS Keychain):

        sidestep auth login --token <bearer-token>
        sidestep auth status

      Discover and invoke operations:

        sidestep ops list
        sidestep api <operationId> --param key=value

      Every API call writes a structured JSONL audit line under
      ~/.sidestep/audit/ (macOS) or ~/.local/state/sidestep/audit/ (Linux).
